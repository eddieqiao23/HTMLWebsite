Bootstrap elements:
* Grid is the 12 people
* Navbar contains the links to the highlights. "Fancier" part is the dropdowns.
* Other things I liked and implemented are the progress bar, tables (the colors and stuff), the card, input (essay in end), and the Jumbotron.
    * Note: I'm not sure if those all count, but there's also the carousel, spinners, alert, etc.
